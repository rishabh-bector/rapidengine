Notice: Unfortunately, due to time constraints & other projects, I'm unable to continue development on Rapid Engine. If anyone is interested in taking over the project, I'm happy to give them an overview of the current project state.

## RapidEngine

A fast 2D and 3D game engine written in Go.
Demo: https://drive.google.com/open?id=144c8FuAeysPKVbRmILE3VxBS8XavHnnl

The above is a demo of Rapid Engine's terrain generation and foliage system.

I'm building the UI for Rapid Engine in a separate repo: https://github.com/rishabh-bector/rapidengine-ui
